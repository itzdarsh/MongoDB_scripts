# MongoDB_scripts
scripts to ease the work with MongoDB

Scripts are written in javascript which MongoDB engine handles efficiently. In order to execute the same simply run:
```
mongo <Connection URI, authentication details> --quiet <script-file-name.js> > script_output.js
```

Output will be saved in the `script_output.js` file which can be inspected later.
